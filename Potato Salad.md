# **THE** Best Potato Salad 

## Ingredients
 - 3lbs (1⅓kg) Yukon Gold (or other "golden") potatoes
    - A note on potatoes: While any potato can be used, yukon gold potatoes will peel nicely and, most importantly, retain a firmness and won't disintigrate into a mush after cooking.
 - 3 tablespoons (45ml) white vinegar
 - 4-5 celery stalks
 - 4 green onions
 - 4 hard boiled eggs (peeled would be best)
 - 1 cup (240ml) mayonnaise or mayo-alternative of your choice
 - 1 tablespoon (15ml) yellow mustard
 - 1-1/2 teaspoons (7.5ml) celery seed (not powder). This is very imporant for the taste of the final product. 
 - 1 teaspoon (5ml) ground black pepper
 - salt to your taste
 - paprika or cayenne pepper garnish to your taste

## Directions
 1. Wash the potatoes thoughly then put them in a pot large enough to cover them completely with water. Bring the water to a boil then reduce heat to a simmering boil. Cook for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked but not over cooked. If the potatoes are too soft (over cooked) you'll end up with *mashed-potato-salad*. Not necessarily bad, but not our goal today.
 2. Drain cooked potatoes and allow them to cool enough to handle. Rinsing with cold water will speed this process.
 3. Peel and cube the potatoes into 1/2" ish (1cm) chunks.
 4. In a large mixing bowl, splash the potatoes with the white vinegar. This will give the resulting potato salad an unexpected and quite pleasant zing. Set aside to finish cooling, perhaps refrigerating overnight.
 5. Dice the celery, chop up the green onions and hard boiled eggs.
 6. Mix in the veggies and eggs to the cooled potatoes.
 7. In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, celery seed, and black pepper. Mix this into the potatoes.
 8. Chill for at least an hour before serving.
 9. Garnish the potato salad with paprika or cayenne.
 10. Serve and Enjoy.
