# Baked Salmon From Frozen


## Ingredients
   - 1 Frozen Salmon Filet (not too thick, whatever that means)
   - Olive Oil
   - (Optional) Spices as desired
   - (Optional) Sliced potatoes or simple dumplings (flour & water)
   - (Optional) Capers 

## Directions
 - Pre-heat the oven to 350°F (unnecessary with an air frier)
 - Make an aluminum-foil box that can be closed tightly and is slightly larger than the salmon filet.
 - Drizzle olive oil in the box.
 - Place the frozen salmon filet in the box
 - Put any spices desired on the salmon and drizzle a bit more olive oil on top the salmon.
 - Put any potatoes, dumplings, or capers in along side the salmon.
 - Close the foil box.
 - Put the box in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes (more for thicker filets, less for thiner).
 - After the initial 20-25 minute baking, open the foil-box, set the oven to broil (or air frier to 400°) and continue to broil/bake for another 5 minutes (air-frier) to 10 minutes (oven).
