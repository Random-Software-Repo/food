# Pesto


## Ingredients
   - 2 cups fresh italian/sweet basil leaves, packed
   - ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
   - ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
   - ⅓ cup pine nuts
   - 3 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
   - ¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste
   - ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste


## Directions
 - Toast the pine nuts in a pan with minimal olive oil. Set aside to cool before continuing.
 - Wash and dry the basil. Remove any stems.
 - In a food processor, pulse the basil and pine nuts until well chopped.
 - Add in the cheese and garlic and pulse again until well chopped.
 - Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while the food processor is running, occasionally scrapping down the sides of the container as needed.
 - Blend until smooth or until it has the texture you desire. More olive oil will allow for a smoother pesto.
 - Mix in the salt and pepper to taste.

## Variations
Each variation can be tried separately or together as desired.

   - Add ¼ to ½ cup roasted red peppers.
   - Add ¼ to ½ cup sun dried tomatoes.
   - Add 1 grilled jalapeño.
   - Add cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper flakes to taste.
   - Add 2 table spoons lemon juice.
   - Use raw pine nuts rather than toasted.
   - Substitute walnuts (untoasted) for pine nuts.
   - Substitute baby spinach for up to ½ of the basil.
   - Try other types of basil (thai basil is stronger).
   - for **Vegan** pesto, substitute nutritional yeast for the cheese, or omit the cheese entirely (you may want to add roasted red peppers or sundried tomatoes to bulk it up a bit in this case).
 
## Makes
 - a little more than 1½ cup of pesto. Ish.
