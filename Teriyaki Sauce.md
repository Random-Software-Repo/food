# Teriyaki Sauce


## Ingredients
   - 45ml (3 tbsp) real maple syrup (golden or amber)
   - 45ml (3 tbsp) soy sauce (lower sodium is fine)
   - 45ml (3 tbsp) cold water
   - 15ml (1 tbsp) Mirin (sweet rice wine)
   - 7-8ml (1 heaping tsp) corn starch 

## Directions
 - Mix all liquids in a non-stick sauce pan.
 - Add in corn starch and mix until disolved.
 - Heat on medium-high heat stiring constantly until the mixture thickens then remove from heat. If the mixture doesn't thicken, you may need to increase the heat or add more corn starch. Adding corn starch is difficult to mix in well when hot. It's best to do this ***before*** heating.

## Variations
   - Replace the maple syrup with 45ml (3 tbsp) packed brown sugar. Disolve the brown sugar into the water/soy sauce/mirin mixture.
   - Thickening agents other than corn starch may work just as well so long as they are not flavored.
 
## Makes
 - Ample sauce for one meal for one person. Could be stretched to two.
