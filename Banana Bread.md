# Banana Bread

## Ingredients
 - 250ml (1 cup) melted butter (unsalted or salted)
 - 300g brown sugar. If you like less sweet banana bread, use a little less. Plain sugar is fine, too. Always measure by weight and not volume, especialy if using raw or other coarse sugars.
 - 10ml (2 teaspoons) vanilla extract
 - 2 large eggs
 - 6 *very* ripe bananas. Bananas that are very brown will make great Banana bread. 
 - 550g (a little more than 3 cups) all purpose flour
 - 10ml (2 teaspoons) baking soda
 - (optional, but not optional) 450g (1lb) broken up pecans. Nuts are ***technically*** optional. Add as many or as few as you want. There is almost no amount of pecans that is too much. While I personally find pecans superior, walnuts will work just as well, and, in fact, many other nuts may be pleasing: Almonds, Macadamia Nuts, Not Peanuts, Brazilnuts. Whatever ***you*** like.
 - (optional) 10g (1½ teaspoons) Raw or other sugar to sprinkle on the top.

## Directions
 - Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
 - In a large bowl: 
    + Cream together butter, sugar and vanilla extract. 
    + Mix in the eggs.
    + Mix in and mash the bananas. Mix until smooth. Small chunks (pea sized) of banana are ok.
 - In a separate bowl, mix together Flour, baking soda and salt (if added).
 - Slowly add the flour mixture to the banana mixture. Mix until completely moistened.
 - (optional) Mix in nuts as desired.
 - Pour the mixture into two buttered 4" x 8" (10cm x 20cm) (ish) bread pans.
 - (optional) Sprinkle the raw sugar lightly and evenly across the top of the batter in the pan. Do not mix in. 
 - Bake for 60 minutes. Test by inserting a long wood pick into the center of the loaf. If it comes out dry, the banana bread is done. If there is batter adhearing to the pick, bake for five or ten minutes longer and test again. You will almost certainly need to do this several times. Use a fresh pick for each test. If you reuse a pick it may not give correct reading as the oils from the previous attempt will cause the batter to *not* adhear on the second use implying the bread is done when it may not be.
